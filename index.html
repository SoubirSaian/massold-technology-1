                <p>There's one simple reason We call this our everyday oxford; Ww were them pretty much every single day </p>

                <h5>Material</h5>
                <p>Just the right amount of sturdy for year round wear. Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly versetile febric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled off the back of a chair.While traditional cotton uses just 25 percent of the world's pesticides, our organic cotton doesn't use a drop.A better shirt responsibly built for the long haul.</p>
